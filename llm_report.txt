We used an LLM (ChatGPT) to assist with high-level explanations, structural 
guidance, and clarifications about the exercise requirements for the 
Kaminsky DNS cache poisoning attack. The LLM helped us understand the 
roles of the attacker client, the attacker authoritative name server, 
the attack flow, and the submission rules.

The LLM also assisted in generating git commit messages.
